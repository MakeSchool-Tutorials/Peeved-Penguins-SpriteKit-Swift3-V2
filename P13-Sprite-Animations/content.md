title: Creating sprite frame animations
slug: sprite-animation
---

In an early chapter you already learned how to create an animation using the timeline
features of SpriteKit (remember the bear?). In this chapter you will learn how to create
a sprite frame animation, using a series of sprite files. You will animate penguins to
sit around the catapult, waiting for their turn to make history and fly.

# Penguin animation action

You're going add this new penguin animation action to the *CharacterActions.sks*.

> [action]
> Select *CharacterActions.sks* in the project outline and add a new action by clicking
> the `+`, name it `JumpPenguin`.
>
> ![Add JumpPenguin action](../Tutorial-Images/p12-04-jump-penguin.png)
>

## Setup the animation

> [action]
> The first thing you need to do is drag the *AnimateWithTextures* action into the
> timeline.
>
> ![SpriteKit Texture Animation](../Tutorial-Images/p12-05-animate-with-textures.png)
>

SpriteKit allows you to sequence the animation frames by dropping them into the
*Textures* box.

The order for this animation will be *penguin_#* `1,2,3,2,4,5,6,5,4`.

> [action]
> Drag each of the *penguin_#.png* assets into the texture box in the order above.
> Set *duration* to `2`
>
> It should look like this when you're finished.
> ![SpriteKit Texture List](../Tutorial-Images/p12-06-penguin-frames.png)
>

Great, you've made a `JumpPenguin` action. Time to apply this to the *GameScene*

# Adding Penguins

> [action]
> Drag a *waitingpenguin.png* to the `Level_1.sks` and set *Z-Position* to `5`.
>
> ![Add waiting penguin](../Tutorial-Images/p12-07-waiting-penguin.png)
>
> Expand the timeline for this sprite and drag in the `JumpAction` action into the
> timeeline.
>
> ![Jumping action](../Tutorial-Images/p12-08-jumping-penuin-action.png)
>
> You will want to repeat the animation forever so set this action repeat to forever.
>
> ![JumpAction Infinity](../Tutorial-Images/p12-09-jumping-penuin-action-repeat.png)
>
> *Copy* and *Paste* this penguin two more times.
>

Run your game... You should see the three penguins blinking and jumping for joy next to
the catapult:

# Improving the animations

The animation looks pretty good. However, it seems unnatural that all three penguins
perform the `JumpAction` at the exact same time. This happens because our timeline
actions all start at zero, this means the animation starts as soon as the object enters
the scene.

# Desynchronize the animations

You can improve this quite easily, click on each *JumpAction* in the timeline and modify
the *Start Timer*, set it to `0` , `0.25` and `0.5` respectivley.

Run your game...

# Summary

Well done! You now have mastered sprite frame animations in SpriteKit.

In the next chapter you are going to polish the gameplay.
